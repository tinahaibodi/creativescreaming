###  screaming with colour - a p5.js experiment

this is a p5js experiment that uses voice detection and cursor movement to multiply content using the word "tina" in a variety of colours. movements with your cursor or making audible noise triggers the creation of words - the more the volume of these actions the more that the words appear.

this was created to demonstrate a complex set of technical actions to illustrate a creative concept.

### installation guide
when using the voice recognition aspect please note for it to fully work you need the speech recognition macoxs command line downloaded for your mac on the high sierra 10.4 (or up) os system
